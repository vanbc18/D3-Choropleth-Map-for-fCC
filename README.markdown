# D3: a Choropleth Map

This is a choropleth map of the US educational attainment between 2010 and 2014.

You can point on any state and a tooltip will display the name of the state, its area and the percentage of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher.

I learnt about what a choropleth map is, how to make 2 API requests, topojson, d3.geoPath() and scaleThreshold(). 

This particular project was really difficult to handle compared to the first projects in Data visualization 
since we needed to make 2 API requests and needed to know how to draw an actual map using SVG. 

The part I struggled with the most was when you need to match the first API request data with the second API request in data-education... But I did it!
